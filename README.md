Home page for Volume Beauty Salon showcasing sleek and responsive HTML, CSS and Javascript
Mostly an exercise of using only vanilla CSS with no bells and whistles.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This was an exercise where I wanted to make a nice looking layout from scratch using only floats in CSS. Media queries in place for responsiveness and some simple CSS keyframe animations.

## Optimizations

With more time I would like to add

  - build out the rest of the web pages for the site
  - Add a Node.js backend that utilizes Mongodb so that users can log in and schedule appointments.
